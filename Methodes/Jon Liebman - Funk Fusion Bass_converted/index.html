Bending The String Up Or Down Will Raise The Pitch Of The Note. The Amount The Pitch Is Raised Depends, Of Course, On How Much You Bend The String. Be Careful With This One, Though. If You Use This Technique Too Much, It Might Sound Kind Of Comy. If You Use It Spar- Ingly And Tastefully, It Can Add A Little Spice To Your Playing.
